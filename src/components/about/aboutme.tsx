              I&apos;ve been into programming for as long as I can remember. I
              wrote my first program when I was 15! Later, my parents got me a
              new HP ProBook, and I{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold">taught myself</span> how to code
              on it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Back in school, I studied{" "}
              <span className="font-semibold">
                Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science,
              </span>{" "}
              which helped me build strong problem-solving skills. I loved
              figuring out how to solve different challenges using programming.
              Even before I had a computer, I was curious about how websites and
              technologies worked, and listening to tech programs on the radio
              kept me motivated.

              improving my skills. I&apos;m always excited to collaborate on new
              projects or tackle interesting challenges.
