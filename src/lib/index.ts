      "The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard while wearing my older sister's motorcycle helmet, counted down from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a bit of momentum I'd be able to get to orbit.",

      "I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design, while I recovered from the multiple surgeries it took to fix my badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I sent my dad's Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a photo back down to our family computer from space.",
